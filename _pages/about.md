## bio
I am a PhD student at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch) and the [Max Planck Institute – Perceiving Systems](https://ps.is.mpg.de/), co-advised by [Michael Black](https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/black), [Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges) and [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/people/krausea/). My primary research interests span **imitation learning**, **diffusion models** and **VLMs**. I am especially excited about creating **generative methods** that enable machines to learn human skills from videos. I am an [ELLIS PhD Student](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) and a [CLS Fellow](https://learning-systems.org/phds).

I previously spent a year at USC, earned my MSc in Mechanical Engineering at Bilkent University under the supervision of [Yildiray Yildiz](https://yildirayyildiz.com/about/), and completed my BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Bilkent University. <br>

## research
My primary focus is on **generative imitation learning**: integrating ideas from **video diffusion models**, **imitation learning**, and **LLMs** to create methods that can accurately mimic human skills in a generative way. I’m particularly interested in **both** **realistic avatar animation** (e.g., character simulation) and **robotics**. Ultimately, I aim to enable humanoid agents —virtual or physical— to master a wide range of tasks by learning from just a handful of demonstrations or even from raw video data alone.

In addition to my work in generative imitation learning, I have **five years** of experience applying **reinforcement learning** and **game theory** to model human behavior in autonomous driving. I remain strongly interested in multi-agent systems, where game-theoretic principles can enhance both **reinforcement** and **imitation learning**.
